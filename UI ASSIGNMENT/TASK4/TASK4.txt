I have designed a fully functional full-stack website from scratch. The name of the website is mediway.com.
In this project, I have used many front-end and Back-end technologies/languages which are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, AJAX, JSON, PHP & phpMyAdmin, and SQL.

Mediway provides assistance and acts as a link between the donator and the needful so that the process remains
convenient and trustworthy. We are delighted to have such donators who are able and ready to donate medicine for 
a noble cause. Also to the ones seeking medicines, we are here to ensure a timely and hassle-free process so that
it can be convenient for you. 

I came up with this project in 2021 during the time of COVID-19 with an incentive that needy people could get some
help in medicines for free by the donators who may or may not have the use of those medicines and want to contribute
them. 

The motive is that one day this project goes live and helps thousands of needy people to get access to lifesaving
medicines for free.

Workflow of the website:
On this website, you'll first land on the cover page which is just the brief info about the website.
On the right-most corner of the navbar, you'll find two buttons which are sign-in or log-in buttons.
Both perform their functionalities well. By using the log-in button you will either land on one of the
two dashboards which are, the Contributor dashboard or the Needful dashboard. 
The contributor profile is for those who want to donate their medicines for free. In the contributor dashboard,
one can fill in your contact details and also fill in the details of the medicine you got (name, quantity, etc).
The needful profile is for those who require medicines. In the Needful dashboard, one can fill in their contact
details and find the medicines available if any.
