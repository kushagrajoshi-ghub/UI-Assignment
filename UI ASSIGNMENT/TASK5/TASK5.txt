If I have to start a software company, I would like to start it with Prateek Singh Bisht and Pulkit Singla as my partners.
This is because we are from the same class and have an excellent understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. 
We are aware of the knowledge that we each have and are able to understand and analyse each other's code very well.
Also, I am a very good programmer and know languages such as C++ and Python alongside being a full-stack developer,
Pulkit is a full-stack web developer, and Prateek has studied data science and machine learning.
With this diverse knowledge, we would make a great team to make the software company successful.
